Hello and welcome to my website!
My name is Thomas, and I'm currently a master's student studying Computer Science at FH Aachen.
When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest technology trends, whipping up something delicious
in the kitchen, or enjoying a good social game or fitness session.
